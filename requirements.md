I need the stack to integrate into sway with wofi
- Hotkey for creating notes, add sources
- Hotkey should be super+n for creating a note
- Hotkey for searching should be super+s

Will need an lsp for autocomplete some stuff (status-tags, tags)

The note taking system has to support the following
obsidian structure recommended to me:
1. Rough Notes
2. Source Material
3. Tags // not going to be a folder
4. Indexes
5. Templates
6. Full Notes

# Needs
Configuration over env vars
