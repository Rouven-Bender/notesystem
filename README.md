# About
This is my current notetaking system that integrates with my WM (sway)
# Usage
have the create.sh and search.sh symlinked into your path
e.g have a bin folder in your home directory that is in your path and symlink them into it
then have sway register a keybind for super+n & super+s for the script names
# Dependencies
## Env vars
- $EDITOR - your preferd editor
- $NOTEBASEPATH - where the notes are stored at
- $TERM - which terminal to use (designed for alacritty as I use a cli option)
## Software
